# bscilN

The end goal with language version N (maybe 5 or so) is to have a full working CIL assembler written in an intermediate language.

To help me get back into the project, I'm taking on the last phase of the project, writing a CIL assembler in CIL. This will also help in determining which language features are needed. (i.e. multiple functions will probably be needed, but is it possible without classes or generics?)
